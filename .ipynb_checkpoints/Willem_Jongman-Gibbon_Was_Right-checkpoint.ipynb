    "**Willem Jongman** (2006): _[Gibbon Was Right: The Decline and Fall of The Roman Economy](https://delong.typepad.com/jongman-gibbon-was-right.pdf)_: \"For the naive historian, it would seem that we now have all we need: we have a range of examples of catastrophic decline, and some potential causes. What we do not yet have, however, are the mechanisms by which this shock propagated through the economic and social system. Imagine a pre-industrial and largely agricultural economy in a fairly stable equilibrium. Next that equilibrium is disturbed by mortality.... The biggest economic and social change, however, was to the land-labour ratio...<!--more-->\n",
    "\n",
    ">...More land per person inevitably means a lower aggregate production: production per hectare must have gone down since there was more land to work in the same amount of time.... Production per man hour must have gone up.... Rents must have gone down, and therefore the incomes of elite land-owners. The Roman  Empire should have turned into a world of happy and prosperous peasants, and much greater social equality than before. The theory is impeccable, but reality was, of course, very different....\n",
    "\n",
    ">A change in rural social relations... from the late second century... a new social, political and legal regime... honestiores and humiliores.... Demand for slaves declined because citizens could now be exploited more fully... the non-economic force of oppression.... The coloni of the _Saltus Burunitanus_ of 180 are not alone to complain to the emperor about increased oppression and growing abuse. When pushed hard enough. they could have moved, but that was precisely what was to become illegal.... The declining legal status of citizens was... an instrument imposed in the face of what would have been an improved economic position for the peasantry....\n",
    "\n",
    ">For me, the interesting thing is the resilience of the Roman state. For more than half a century, the Severan regime maintained... integrity and continuity.... The surprise is... that it survived... for so long that the crisis later became known as the crisis of the third century, rather than the crisis of the second century that I think it was.... As remarkable... is the recovery from Diocletian....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The real beginnings of that decline and fall... in... a period of much colder and dryer weather, and in the scourge of the Antonine Plague. With the growth of its Empire, with the growth of its cities, and with the growth of a system of government and transportation based on those cities, Rome and created the perhaps most prosperous and successful pre-industrial \n",

    "...Population decline because climate change whomps agricultural productivity I understand: Everyone loses, and complex, civilized society may not survive because such societal systems have a hard time scaling down. Somebody still wants to have the same resources they had in the conflicts that produces go very negative sum very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But population decline while agricultural productivity stays constant—due to the Antonine and JustinIan Plagues, or due to a temporary volcano winter, for example? Those have to raise agricultural productivity per farmer. And, yes, the upper class men will try to extract more from farmers. But if they could extract more from farmers, they would have done so back when they were riding high: they have and never had much charity. So from my perspective it is an uphill climb to clean that present material standards of living would decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now peasant life expectancy and security could decline: the _pax Romana_ was a real thing, and so was the Viking blood eagle. Now landlords could fail to recognize the new situation, and dissipate huge amounts of resources in “wars of attrition trying to extract more than could sustainably be extracted, thus leaving everybody worse off. And as cities take it in the neck the loss of economies of scale and Smithian division of labor could transform the city countryside relationship from one of extraction plus trade-for-conveniences to one of simple extraction.\n",
